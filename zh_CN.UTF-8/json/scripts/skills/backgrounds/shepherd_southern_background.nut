    "translation": "{%name% 只是一个简单的牧羊人，来自一个简单的小镇，花了很多年照顾他的羊群。 | 像 %townname% 这样可爱的地方应该有一个这样可爱的牧羊人，像是 %name%。 | %name% 在埋葬父亲的同一天继承了他的羊群。 | 小时候，%name% 偶然发现了一个死去的牧羊人和他身边无精打采的羊群。 那男孩拿起牧羊人的手杖，接着他的工作干了了许多年。 | 比狗更色盲的 %name% 总是喜欢和颜色喜人的绵羊在一起。 | 当 %name% 从塔上掉下来时，一群羊阻止了他的坠落。 他发誓要成为这片土地上最安全的牧羊人来报答他们的牺牲。 | %name% 把羊从一个镇带到另一个镇，把它们的羊毛卖给裁缝，把皮卖给制革厂，从中获利。 | 放羊是 %name% 能找到的最简单的工作。 | 和他看管的羊群一样无害，%name% 通过牧羊，在残酷的世界里寻找和平。 | 从来没有人能在人类中找到好朋友，%name% 更喜欢羊的阴郁智慧。 | 从小被欺负的 %name% 在放羊的过程中找到了安宁。 | %name% 那群贪玩温顺的羊通过相当粗野的教养给了他一种平静和安详。 | 曾经被误认为是 {预言家 | 新的救世主}，%name% 逃脱了 {宗教信众 | 愤怒的检察官} 是通过躲进牧羊工作做到的。 | 整天看管{绵羊 | 绵羊}在草地上吃草听起来有点无聊，但对于 %name% 来说却很快乐。 | %name% 因为一场牧羊比赛上了道，把牧羊当作一项竞争异常激烈的工作。 | 一直是一个温柔善良的男孩，牧羊对这样的人来说很有意义是对于 %name%。 | 逃离虐待他的 {母亲 | 父亲 | 姐姐 | 哥哥 | 叔叔 | 姑姑}，%name% 通过当一个牧羊人得到了宁静。} {在上帝信徒和邪教信徒之间的宗教冲突中，他的羊群受到了那些寻找替罪羊和祭品的人的愤怒。 | 有一次他用手杖挡开了 {强盗 | 狼群} 牧羊人拿着手杖，想知道他是否比他原本以为的更加身强力壮。 | 随着时间的推移，这个人觉得 {他的职业已经离他远去了。 | 好像他的心思不在这上面了。} {他悲伤地退休了 | 他挂上了他的牧羊杖} 去找别的工作。 | 他觉得自己似乎看到了世界的美丽，却没有完全体验到，于是决定放弃牧羊。 | 当粗陋的、毛茸茸的野兽屠宰他的羊群时，牧羊人开始寻求复仇。 | 不幸的是，这个人唯一的同伴，一只牧羊犬被 {强盗 | 兽人 | 狼群} 杀了，让这个和平的人去寻求复仇。 | 然而，由于不幸陷入了一个诈骗者的阴谋中，牧羊人突然需要比他的羊群所能提供的更多的硬币。 | 然而，他生活中的寂寞终于打倒了这个牧羊人。 | 但是长时间的日日夜夜独自一人使牧羊人和其他任何人一样疲惫不堪。 | 但他无法摆脱父亲对他男子气概的期许，有一天他放下手杖，去寻找一个更有男子气概的职业。 | 但有一天，他一边放牧一边织羊毛，把他的所有羊都牵到悬崖边上。 | 但在一个雨天的下午，他思考着：除了整天盯着羊看之外，他还得做些什么。 | 不幸的是，关于他在自己的羊群里所做的事的传闻太令人难堪了，他不得不逃到更绿、更容易接受的牧场。 | 可悲的是，醉心于暴力的游牧民们偶然发现了他的羊群。 贝茜，小阿达，甚至新生的山羊羔羊都被血腥地带走了。} {在进城考虑问题时，%name% 无意中接到一个佣兵的征召。 没有什么可以损失的，他准备报名了。 | 这片土地没有地方容得下一个平和的牧羊人。 是时候开始新生活了。 | %name% 的脖子下面有一个生锈的小铃铛。 它是另一个生命的遗物，也许也是新生活的标志。 | 他发誓仍能听到他的羊群的叫声。 出于某种原因，这并不能激发人们对他的战斗技巧的信心。 | 虽然尽可能的保持平和，但没有了他的羊群，这个人还是有点迷失。 | 虽然他不是一个战士，但他知道如何保持严密的队形。 | %name% 对星星了如指掌，能在黑暗中找到一个声音，就像一只盲狗嗅着食物一样。 | 走了这么久使 %name% 的腿变得结实，但他最有战斗经验的是使用棍子。 | 世界在需要的时候通常不会求助于牧羊人，但现在是一个非常困难的世界。 | 盯着牧羊人，你在想，情况有多糟糕才会使这样一个站在这儿。 | %name% 把几乎所有的武器当手杖一样带着，并且他有一个坏习惯，就是敲打别人的腿来让他们移动。 | %name%的谦卑对成为佣兵的团结兄弟们来说是个短暂的慰藉。 | %name% 看起来他不会伤害苍蝇，但是经过良好的训练，你可以看到他会造成更多的伤害。 | %name% 不像其他佣兵那样有凶残的念头，但和其他人一样，他可以接受各种训练。 | %companyname% 的有些人比绵羊强不了多少。 也许 %name% 在这里有一席之地。}",
